                    STL files might be ubiquitous in the world of 3D modeling, but they're not ideal for precise CAD workflows. 
                    What they <em>do</em> offer, though, is a convenient on-ramp for sculpting and rapid ideation—especially 
                    when working with tools like <em>Blender</em>, where artistic flexibility meets procedural control through 
                    hybrid mesh and surface modeling.

                <p>
                    This creative foundation becomes even more powerful when connected to modern AI and computer vision pipelines. 
                    Thanks to insights from board member Harish Anand, I've recently deepened my understanding of how AI-assisted 
                    tools can help bridge the gap between rough digital assets and refined, contextualized digital twins. It's a 
                    critical part of my work, which sits at the intersection of robotics and the sciences. Now it is enabling 
                    continuous <em>ratcheting</em> of innovation between science and art—an idea inspired by another board member, 
                    Dr. Ramon Arrowsmith in the context of science and engineering.

                <h3><strong>LLMs as Creative Co-Designers</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) are more than chatbots—they are becoming <strong>embedded infrastructure</strong> 
                    in design and engineering workflows. I use:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cursor IDE</strong>: A deeply integrated development environment that combines Claude and other 
                        LLMs with intelligent code context.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Claude MCP</strong>: Tools that leverage the 
                        <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> to standardize 
                        interactions with AI systems, bridging context between modeling platforms and AI assistants.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Together, these tools let me manage complex, context-rich modeling pipelines with greater fluency and modularity.

                <h3><strong>Navagunjara and DeepGIS-XR: Fusing 3D and 2D Worlds</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Ongoing <strong><a href="/earthinnovationhub/navagunjara">Navagunjara Reborn</a></strong> Burning Man Honoraria 
                    Art Grant Project with Richa Maheshwari (Boito) found a natural integration with 
                    <a href="https://deepgis.org" target="_blank"><strong>DeepGIS</strong></a> in an attempt to blend narrative and 
                    spatial data—<a href="https://deepgis.org/label/3d/" target="_blank">combining digital twins with architectural 
                    and cartographic layers</a>. This approach enables hybrid reporting, where immersive 3D visualizations remain 
                    traceable to 2D plans, eventually through GIS systems, with metadata-rich documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not just about visualization—it's about <strong>reproducibility</strong> and 
                    <strong>traceability</strong>, which are essential whether you're building a robot armature or coordinating a 
                    mixed-media art installation.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Model Context Protocols: Interoperability by Design</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    A key enabler of all this is the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>, which was first brought to my 
                    attention this March by our Burning Man camp mayor, Christopher Filkins. It's a relatively new open protocol 
                    that allows client applications—such as Blender, FreeCAD, Cursor, and Claude Desktop—to share structured 
                    context with one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using <a href="https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp" target="_blank"><strong>Blender-MCP</strong></a> and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp" target="_blank"><strong>FreeCAD-MCP</strong></a>, I can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Maintain <strong>semantic fidelity</strong> from generative AI outputs to engineering models.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable bidirectional context updates (e.g., changes in text-based reasoning or geometry sync across clients).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automate capture of modeling intent, assumptions, and constraints—making them visible and machine-readable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Claude MCP clients</strong> showcased at 
                    <a href="https://www.claudemcp.com">claudemcp.com</a> are a good place to start exploring this ecosystem. 
                    Applications like <em>Cursor</em> illustrate how distributed tools can coordinate design logic, AI prompting, 
                    and multi-modal outputs through a shared protocol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In closing, the convergence of sculpting tools, AI co-pilots, and interoperability standards like MCP is 
                    reshaping how we think about design and fabrication. Whether you're working with robots, installations, or 
                    digital city models, the power to integrate vision, language, and geometry into a single contextual loop is 
                    finally within reach.
